                    <a href= "https://unixpapa.com/floodit/" target="_blank"> Based off this web game, </a> 
                    FloodIt is a single-player game that was done as a pair programming 
                    assignment for my Fundamentals of Comp. Sci. 2 class, with this assignment coded in 
                    Java. Techniques used in FloodIt include while loops, for loops, methods, void 
                    methods, classes, abstract classes, and interfaces, as well as an image library. 
                    The goal of this game is to turn the entire board into one color, starting from 
                    the top left box. By clicking on another colored box that is next to the top left 
                    box, the starting box will turn the corresponding color, adding to the amount 
                    of boxes that have been "flooded" as to say. Next, you click on a box of a 
                    different color to .change all your boxes to, with the current boxes you 
                    have "absorbing" the ones next to them of the color clicked, increasing 
                    the amount of boxes that have been flooded. This game is challenging for 
                    the fact that the player only has a limited amount of turns that they can 
                    make, so they must plan their colors clicked wisely. Although this game 
                    may seem challenging at first, after a few tries, it turns out to be a lot of fun!
